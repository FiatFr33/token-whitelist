 "description": "#### Welcome to the IOTA Whales collection\n#\nCreated in November 2021, IOTA Whales is the OG IOTA generative art project. The whales were generated by applying a mix of paint and vector algorithms to a selection of base images. This is not a layer based approach (as for example the Bored Apes PFP), nor a filter or StyleGAN, but something entirely different, that will result in a very unique outcome every time. Please have a look at the images already minted to see what you might get.\n#\nThis Warholian approach to art, in which the artist removes himself and surrenders a good part of control to randomness, has always intrigued me, and this project has proven to be a perfect playground for it.\n#\nThere are a total of 2,779 whales. This number was chosen because 2,779 Ti make up IOTA's marketcap.\n#\nYou can find more information about the process **[here](https://pixeldoggy.com/iotawhales)**",
