 "description": "I think it is safe to say everyone experiences 'dark days'. Whether it is the weather or whatever. And in this sentence lies the solution, humor and acceptance. \nHowever let’s 1rst go into how we get into this dark spiral. Where thoughts seem to find the bad side in all events and faith is not on your side. \nSome people can get stuck for decades, others ‘only’ experience a few hard moments. There are an infinite amount of reasons and most lead back to a defensive mechanism. To defend ourselves and or others.\nMost of the time there is no instant cure. It takes pain to know bliss. However, there are ways to make the road less lonely and with more direction. \nWe are not alone, most of us go through rough times, the grass isn't always greener on the other side. This knowledge can make us feel less guilty for going through a hard time. Take your time. People are grateful we are doing this work. Whether we choose it or not. When we share our adventures we can make this knowledge real, feel understood and even find that others might be having an even harder time. Self pity can take everyone down. Accept life throws you punches, share it and you can find there is also abundance.\nSo we have 3 key points to focus on here, sharing, acceptance and realizing what abundance is. In these you’ll find all emotions including humor. Which is a great way to talk about things. *“Life is ridiculous..”*\n\n🍀 𝓘𝓷𝓯𝓲𝓷𝓲𝓽𝓮 𝓵𝓾𝓬𝓴 🍀",
