 "description": "Disclaimer: Everything you are about to read is just a perspective. For real facts, check google hahaha.\n\nThe Placebo. Wikipedia describes it as a sugarpill. I call it ‘The power of trust’. Once we relax and don’t think about a negative outcome our mental and physical health improves. It makes a lot of sense. Less stress hormones is less disease. \nSo how can we use this as our advantage? Yoga has got a nice way to experience it. Meditation, body movement and breathwork. To trust that your body can heal itself in itself prevents a lot of suffering. Whether the disease is prevented or cured or just the symptoms is important. But what is vital is life quality. To believe / know your breath can bring you relaxation, or perhaps your dog or cat or a tree or walking bare feet or a crystal or music, this knowing or perhaps even better, surrendering, is the key to quality of life and so a better immune system.\nOnce we surrender, we start to experience, instead of worrying about the experience.\n\n🍀 ℐ𝓃𝒻𝒾𝓃𝒾𝓉ℯ ℒℴ𝓋ℯ 🍀\nℛ𝒾𝓈𝒾𝓃ℊ 𝒮𝓊𝓃\n𝒜𝒴𝒜 𝓃𝒶𝓉𝓊𝓇ℯ\n",
