 "description": "Did you know that ALFONS loves spring? He does!\n\nThis collection is diffrent. \nItÂ´s not part of the regular series. \n\nEvery green collection ALFONS costs only 1Mi. But the royalty level is at 60%. This means that the artist gets 60% of the price if somebedy (re)-sells his Alfons. Be aware about this when buying.\n\nThe green collection. This is art. This is satire.\n\nThis is one of the first \"Art Satire\" - Projects in the Cryptospace.\n\nThis \"Alfons Trekner\"-Collection again shows the development from the Basic Alfons Trekner without many effects to the final picture of this collection which has lots of artefacts and effects.\n\n7 Steps - 7 beautiful unique pictures.\n\nCheck out the details of the final version!\n\nThe way of creation is the artists secret.\n\nThis is the green collection of our lovely Alfons Trekner. Others will follow. Maybe. Or not?! Every collection could be the final one!\n\nOne Alfons / person only.",
