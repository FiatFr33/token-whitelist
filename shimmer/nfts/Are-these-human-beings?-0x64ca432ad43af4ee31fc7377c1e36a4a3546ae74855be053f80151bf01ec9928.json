 "description": "So I recently had this thesis of life developement on planets in a solar system like our earth. Is an intelligent form of live which is able to communicate via language, form communities into large societys, conquer the whole planet, create an economy and be so technically advanced to explore the borders of their world into the universe, always going to develop from a small unicellular to an upstanding, straight walking head on top creature with two eyes, a nose and mouth like us humans on earth? This art gallery is about humanoid or human-like creature of which some may not be from planet earth. \n\nDrawn with S Pen Book 360 ---\n\nJoin Award in group @ space (https://soonaverse.com/space/0x3abbca42650fad346f03d11106c95a952845d006/overview)  for XP and 15% discount on weekly released NFTs homemade by myself.
