 "description": "YODOT is a collection of NFT, whose design has been inspired by the biblical story of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\n\nThe word Yodot comes from Yod, the 10th letter of the Hebrew alphabet, which is represented by a dot and a small tail. We wanted to represent beings with a reptiloid aspect, inspired by the serpent of Genesis, and with a rounded shape, which can evoke a fruit, as well as the letter Yod itself.\n\nThe large eyes represent the phrase of Genesis 3:7 \"7 And the eyes of them both were opened...\"\n\n\n---------------\n\nThere are 300 unique designs, each Yodot is different. In addition to getting a unique piece of art for you to use as you wish. By getting one of these NFTs, you will get benefits, such as discounts and other utilities. Your utility will evolve over time with the success of Atelier22. The discount will vary depending on the NFT obtained, starting from a 2% discount. You will be able to accumulate discounts by purchasing more than 1 NFT, up to a maximum of 20%. In addition, there will be 2 special NFT that will give a 50% discount for life.\n\n\n---------------\nThis collection is part of a saga of 4 collections, each in a different style: 3D, Psychedelic Pixel art, oil painting and Japanese Anime style.",
