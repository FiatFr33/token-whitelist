 "description": "Let me tell you something. You don't know what you look like from the inside. It is not really possible to define and feel the point of conciousness in your brain. And if you could and you realize everything that you think and feel is inside that slimy oversized chewing gum, you would probably want forget and erase the thought of seeing your own brain. For me, sometimes thinking about my own brain and existence becomes scary. In the end, I always come to the conclusion that everything that exists, the whole universe with all galaxys, stars and solar system is just a precalculated, for ever running calculation which has been solved in its own complexity. I even start to think that once I am dead and gone, everything just stops existing and will be recalculated and the simulation stars from the beginning. It is unlikely, but my schizophrenic mind just can't stop once it accelerates. Hope you enjoy these hand crafted virtual pencil creations. Get your Brain NFTs to present in your collection.",
