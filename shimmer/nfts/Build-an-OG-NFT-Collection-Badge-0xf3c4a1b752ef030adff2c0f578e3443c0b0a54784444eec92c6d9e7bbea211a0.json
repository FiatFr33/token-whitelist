 "description": "SoonLabs is dedicated to creating the most positive experience for our users. In that spirit, we will be gradually opening access to NFT creators to manage the potential number of spammers on the network. We have partners that we have been collaborating with for many weeks, who are going to help us scale the marketplace gradually over a period of time and they will be prioritized for badge issuance, other badges will be awarded on a case-by-case basis. \n\nOnce we begin the rollout of NFT trading you will see us accelerate and then more or less open by April. We understand everyone is very, very excited, but we want to be reasonable and responsible, without the safeguards of the SOON token to provide staked access we have to make sure there are limits in the first phase of operations.",
