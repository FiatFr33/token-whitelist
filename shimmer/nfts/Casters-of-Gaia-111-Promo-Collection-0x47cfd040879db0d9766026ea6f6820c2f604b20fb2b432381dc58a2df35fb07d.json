The collection is built up of 11,111 2D illustrated digital artworks featuring a Caster and their Summon.\n##\n111 Promo Casters - 1000 Genesis Casters - 10000 Generative Casters\n##\n**HOW TO MINT MY 111 PROMO CASTER**\n##\nBeen a little bit of a journey to get this setup for you. In theory if you hold the 111 Promo Badge, you should be able to pick up a Caster from this collection at a discounted price.\n##\nYou should see the price grayed out with a 1Mi. If you don't see that there's a chance you might need some XP.\n##\nI have a badge you can apply for here if you do need some XP: https://soonaverse.com/award/0xaf8fc3f7c8bb323f5614ec38eadabe75c841c946/overview\n##\nThere has to be a 1Mi transaction charge for Dust Protection, I'm more than happy to send that back to you.\n##\nAny issues, please do get in touch. We're all here early figuring things out together!\n##\n**MORE INFO REGARDING THE 111 PROMO COLLECTION**\n##\nCongratulations to everyone who won a 111 Promo Caster, the majority of these have gone out in the recent competitions, where we made a push to tell the world about fee-less green minting on the Tangle. The truth is, without us spreading the word... Inefficient minting could stay the norm and cryptocurrencies could contribute to drastically rising CO2 emissions forever. \n##\nWe have a real chance to move away from that future. As NFT popularity surges, all of us here know that they can be minted without seriously harming our home. It's up to us to convince the rest of the world to move to better and greener tech. That's for the sake of everyone and everything living on Earth. We might not be able to completely halt climate change but we can do our part to slow it down!\n##\n**LORE**\n##\nGaia exists on the Tangle. A world so abundant with clean energy that the inhabitants can conjure magical creatures out of thin air.\n##\nVideo: https://twitter.com/i/status/1495356644611575812\n##\n**RARITY**\n##\nThere are 5 levels of rarity built into each layer of the NFTs. The rarer the item the less of it there is in the set.\n##\nCommon (C), Uncommon (UC), Rare (R), Super Rare (SR), Legendary (L)\n##\nThe set was built up of 400 digitally illustrated layers, drawn by Green NFT, you can find a breakdown of those layers in this video: https://twitter.com/CastersOfGaia/status/1503086425088086023\n##\nThe story elements were wrote by Green NFT and his Fiancee (who is starting to warm to NFTs after all the positive things you've said about her. P.s the funnier story beats are hers.)\n##\n**GAME-PLAY**\n##\nEach layer also has a stat value attached and some even have abilities. Several abilities have been amended since the Genesis Launch for better wording and play-ability, your Genesis might have just become slightly rarer (more scarce in the collection) with the changes.\n##\nThe game-play rule set is a more simplified version of another of Green NFTs projects 'Crypto Knights' but with a couple of changes to the mechanics. There's more information on the Discord. (If you're someone who knows how to code please get in touch, there's been a huge call for a digital version of the game instead of Tabletop and this would be cool to see but I'd need help with it.)\n##\n**THE FIRSTS**\n##\nWe all love our firsts in this space. I'm fairly happy with the Casters as they're unique even in the wider NFT ecosystem.\n##\nI've deliberately incorporated Twitters official hexagonal NFT profile shape into the design of these artworks, preempting IOTA's \u0026 The Tangles recognition on that social media platform in the future.\n##\nEach Caster has a unique name, they aren't just a number. To take that idea of individualization even further, each Casters has a descriptive backstory based on the layers that they're made up of.\n##\nAnd finally there are game-play stats baked into the assets. I've made my own game-play rules but maybe the community can innovate on it even further.\n##\n**THE $41,000,000,000 MISSION!**\n##\nThe NFT market is currently worth a whopping $41B! I believe that can and will filter through into the IOTA ecosystem now we have fee-less NFTs!\n##\nGas is a thing of the past! The technology is proven, there's no need to continue wasting money and energy minting ineffectively when a greener solution exists right now!\n##\nSo it's our job to deliver that message. IOTAs energy efficiency is an industry game changer and we're going to be the one's who get the word out!\n##\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBxEn_CS1p4\u0026t=\n##\nIf you purchase a Caster please use it to further the message of green minting. This project is only a success in my mind if we're able to move the NFT industry at large to a more ecologically sound network!\n##\n**DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING**\n##\nPlease only buy into my project if you think it has value, I recently made a video on what to look out for when searching for projects to back to help my community navigate the world of NFTs a little better:\n##\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h9Q-4LJF6k\n##\nGreen NFTs value for me, is attempting to bring the $41B NFT market to a less carbon intensive network and being a catalyst for that to happen. I want to use my creative skills to do some good in the world and hope others will join me in pioneering that mission.\n##\n**THANK YOU!**\n##\nHonestly, did not expect the 1000 Genesis to sell out in 45 minutes. Truly humbled by the response, for me it shows me how passionate this community is about fee-less and green minting.\n##\nI want to leave you with this video that was one of the foundations for the Green NFT project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2SqqjRn_c0\u0026t=\n##\n**Ikigai** | Your reason for being, this helped guide me to this project, the core principles are:\n##\n**What do you love?** For me, it's creativity, storytelling, digital art.\n##\n**What are you good at?** Animation/ motion design, video editing, script writing, voice acting (debatable) and producing educational content.\n##\n**What are you paid for?** I've worked in the creative industry for over 10 years, from motion tracking on AAA video games, editing TV commercials to designing and marketing some of the biggest gaming brands.\n##\n**What does the world need?** Greener technology, less CO2 emissions, transparency, more recognition of creative people and the impact they have on the culture, healthier communities!\n##\nThanks for taking part and helping me find me reason for being!\n##\n\n",
