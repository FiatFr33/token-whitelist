 "description": "*Did you ever wonder what else you can do with all the map material that you normally use to drive with your VW Golf from Augsburg to Bodensee?*\n##\nLet me inspire you with this beautiful collection of all **2058 German cities** as of 31.12.2021. I only considered administratively independent communes with **city rights**. Of course I cannot make sure that every map contains the proper street network, but I gave my best and I hope, you forgive me.\n##\nCreated with great care and big ðŸ’š for detail, every map contains the whole street network of a commune in a **high resolution**. To celebrate Shimmer's release, the color of **primary roads** fits to the identity colors of Shimmer.\n##\nThe **price** of each map is based on the respective floor area of the commune, divided by 1 million. The bigger the city, the more popular the NFT, the higher the price - easy! So be fast, if you want to call yourself the owner of your favorite city, there is **only one of each** in this collection.\n##\nIf you own **5 maps within this collection**, you will be awarded to make a wish. In this case, just participate in the award and get the badge. I will then add your personal map to a special airdrop collection.\n##\n**Tip**: use [Soonaverse Search](https://soonaverse.com/market/nfts) to filter and find your city.\n##\n*Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed creating it!*",
