 "description": "Welcome back to my **second collection** of beautiful network maps all around the world - this time: **countries**.\n\nThe collection consists of unique **204 states** around the world including states having (un-)disputed sovereignty and states having a special political status. Compiling a list such as this can be a complicated and controversial process, as there is no definition that is binding on all the members of the community of nations concerning the criteria for statehood. I used different sources for the network data and the map backgrounds, so the quality might differ.\n\nAnyway, we are all **humans of one world** and should treat each other with **respect, kindness and** ðŸ’™.\n\nThe Shimmer price of each map is based on the respective floor area of the country in sqm, divided by 1 billion. The bigger the country, the more popular the NFT, the higher the price - my thoughts. The price will be at least 1 SMR in regards of IOTA protocol's dust protection mechanism.\n\nI hope to continue soon...",
