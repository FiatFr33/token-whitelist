 "description": "The original TAG called Pifostio is a humorous voice, possibly using slang that is no longer in use, which in Spanish means a chaotic mess, an unintentional or inevitable tangle, or a situation that gets out of control. The metaphorical language creates a semantic field with threads and spinning wheels, with colored threads, the spools where those colored threads escape and become tangled, united in an amorphous and entropic chaotic event. TAG Pifostio: For us, PIFOSTIO is the way to refer to Mr. Mundo. Defined by a combination of humor and absurdity, if such a character exists, he is the head of power. This free, popular form comes from the verb \"pifiar,\" which means to make any mistake, carelessness, or blunder.\n\nWe are reissuing the Manifest DODA. There is only one piece that is considered an original work for gallery marketplace and there will be no others. It is the only one that will be sold without a project stamp. What we offer here is an SFT with a promotional print run of 21 units. This second airdrop is intended to continue building community around our project. Tag Lab wants to increase its membership and therefore wants to give its community this iconic foundational NFT.

Please note that 1Mi or 1SMR will always need to purchase the NFT due to the 'dust' protection mechanism of the IOTA protocol. You can receive these discounts by joining our Discord or Telegram.",
