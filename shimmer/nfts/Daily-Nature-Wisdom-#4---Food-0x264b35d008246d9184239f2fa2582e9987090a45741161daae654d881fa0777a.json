 "description": "Food doesn't grow in the supermarket. The whole process is vital. From seed to apple, from mycelium to mushroom, from egg to chicken.\n\nFood has got way more nutrients when it is biological and not genetically modified. It may not look as amazing, perfect size and huge yields. But a natural apple is allot healthier.\n\nFlora and fauna can be even more healthy when the surroundings are have been good. Flora \u0026 Fauna is mostly made of water and water has got crystals. These crystals are way stronger when the right resonance has been and is in in and around it.\nThis means even music can make a plant grow faster and be healthier. DYOR.\nPlants and mushrooms also send out a certain frequentie pattern. This has been recorded and turned into music. Nature just keeps on giving!\n\nInfinite love,\nAYA nature ",
