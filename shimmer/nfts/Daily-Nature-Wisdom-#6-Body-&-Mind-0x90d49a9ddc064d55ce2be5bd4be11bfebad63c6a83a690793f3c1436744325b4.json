 "description": "The body \u0026 mind reflect each other. They are connected, it seems obvious, but most of us forget how powerful this knowledge is. \n\nEvery sigh, itch, body movement and posture are a direct result of what goes on in the mind. This goes both ways. When we see someone in a certain body posture, it is common that we unconsciously copy that posture. After that the mind follows, with that also our emotions.\n\nBeing aware of this can be a great tool to get out of certain thought loops and to start sitting straight, have relaxed shoulders, butt cheeks etc.\nOnce you are aware you can change your body posture and your mind \u0026 emotions will follow. And the other way goes the same, think of the bright side, humor and your body starts to relax.\nThere is even laugh therapy where people just start laughing together. It is very infectious and also very freeing to stop being so serious.\n\nSo, if you are tense, start with the breath. Slowly full breath in, lift shoulders to the ears, tens up all face muscles aaand relaxxx.\n\nIf you like to have more tested tools, research yoga for example. It literally means: To connect / honor the mind \u0026 body. It is not a religion, it is a way of living. Of course there are many other ways than yoga, but since I've done yoga teacher training, I might just do a ‘daily wisdom’ about it. Or more. The wisdom of yoga alone is very freeing (for many).\n\n🍀 ℐ𝓃𝒻𝒾𝓃𝒾𝓉ℯ ℒℴ𝓋ℯ 🍀\nℛ𝒾𝓈𝒾𝓃ℊ 𝒮𝓊𝓃\n𝒜𝒴𝒜 𝓃𝒶𝓉𝓊𝓇ℯ",
