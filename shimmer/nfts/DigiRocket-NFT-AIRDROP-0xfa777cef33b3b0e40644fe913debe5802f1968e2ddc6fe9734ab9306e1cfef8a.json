 "description": "This is a collection of DigiRocket NFT from different Classes for airdrop winner. To give our airdrop winners the opportunity to hand over the NFTs, we have created this possibility. The winners will transfer the smallest possible amount of 5 Mi to purchase the NFT and we will transfer 5 Mi back.\nIn the near future it will be possible to use the Rocket-NFTs in the game. Depending on the class, rockets have specific abilities that are unlocked for the player. The idea for the DigiRocket game was inspired by the Tangle technology. Use the rocket to move around the tangle world and beat the crypto market competition by completing the levels. In the game you can collect IOTA coins and pay them out to your private wallet. The team DigiMine wishes you fun to play and earn IOTA coins.",
