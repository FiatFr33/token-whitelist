 "description": "Art is produced when imagination or creativity is used to create something that can be directly experienced through our senses. Although visual art that is witnessed through our sense of sight is the most common form, art can appeal to our other senses as well, such as our auditory or tactile perceptions. I present a unique form of art with concepts that convey an inner meaning\n \nSupport me if you like the artwork. Thank you",
