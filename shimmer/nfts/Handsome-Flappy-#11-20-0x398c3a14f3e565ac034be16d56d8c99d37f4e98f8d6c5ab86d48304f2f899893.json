 "description": "The second collection of Handsome Flappy\n\nFrom a total of 30 Handsome Flappy's \u0026 Steinschleudi's you get here the opportunity to be one of the first. Since there are only 10 pieces per collection, the number per buyer is limited to 1 NFT. When you mint a Handsome Steinschleudi NFT, you can mint one Handsome Flappy (#11-20) for free.\n\nYou can find the whole roadmap on my Homepage https://HandsomeFlappy.com\n\nWithin less than a month we have already collected over 900 Mi for a good cause. Be a part of the community and support non-profit organizations at the same time.\n\nHave a great day, Hanna",
