 "description": "The first collection of Handsome Flappy\n\nA big thank you to all early adopters!\nAll OG NFT owners will not be forgotten in the future, especially on the first sale. A big part of my concept is that owners of my NFT will get rewards of all kinds over time. We will see in which direction it develops. I dream of one Handsome Flappy real life doll. Would be incredibly awesome, wouldn't it?\n\nBe a part of the community and support non-profit organizations at the same time.\n\nFind out what is behind my project\nhttps://HandsomeFlappy.com",
