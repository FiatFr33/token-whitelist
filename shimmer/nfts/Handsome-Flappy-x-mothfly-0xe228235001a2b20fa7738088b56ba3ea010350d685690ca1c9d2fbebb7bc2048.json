 "description": "This special collaboration between Handsome Flappy \u0026 mothflystudio includes 250 hand-drawn mothfly NFTs. This is the first collection where you have the opportunity to own a real mothfly NFT for a really low price and do something good at the same time. Because 90% of the proceeds go to TeamSeas, you help to clean our oceans from plastic. For every 1 euro, 1 kg of plastic waste is removed from the world's oceans. 10% goes to the artist.\nThis collection includes 6 different designs with the following rarities. Space Flappy 2%, IOTA Flappy 4%, Smoking Flappy 8%, Meteorite Flappy 16%, Flappy with Fly 30%, Normal Flappy 40%.\n\nMore about my project: https://handsomeflappy.com/",
