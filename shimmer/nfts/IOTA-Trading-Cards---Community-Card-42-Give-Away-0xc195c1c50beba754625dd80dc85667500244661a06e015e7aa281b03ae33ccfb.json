 "description": "In this Collection you can get your give away Card 42. You can only get this give away if you are owner of the Award 42. \n\nThe Card 42 will never be sold by myself and is after this giveaway 100% in circulation. So for the Award 42 HODLERS its much easier to get a Collectors Ranking Card. Thats NICE. IsnÂ´t it? :)\n\n*ATTETNION:* On Monday 11.04.22 a proposal on soonaverse will start. You decide who will get the collected dust protection.\nFirst decision will be:\n\n-Donate to a charity \nor\n-Donate to an IOTA project \n\nI decided following:\nIf you want to get your Dust Protection back, please write me a Mail on \n\ninfo@iotatradingcards.com \n\nwith your Soonaverse name. Than I will refund the dust protection to the Firefly address in your Soonaverse account.\n\nIf you want to spent your dust protection, you have nothing more to do. Only enjoy your rare Card 42 and vote for the donation place. \n\n@IOTAPunks and @IOTA Trading Cards will round up the total and donate to a charity to help some people.",
