 "description": "## Hi Card lovers out there\n\nHere is the first Add-On for the Regular Series of the biggest NFT Card Game Collection on Soonaverse: \n##\nThe IOTA Trading Cards - Community Hero Deck\n##\nThis Card Deck contains 10 different Community Hero Cards. Every Card exists exactly 130 times after the last proposal on Soonaverse.com, you decided, that the limitation of the extended Decks should be much more. \n##\nThat means that only 130 Card lovers can collect a Full Regular Deck and a Full Community Hero Deck together. The first 10 Collectors who get the both Decks together (alternative a Regular Collectors Card + a full Community Hero Deck) will be able to get the \"Trading Collectors\" Badge and the strong, on 10 pieces, limited Trading Collectors Card for free (*1Mi for dust Protection is needed)\n##\n## Collections Size\n##\nBe aware that in this collection only 129 Cards/Card are available, because the missing one Card is a giveaway to itÂ´s owner and given out in a separate Give Away Collection.\n##\n##\n## For more details of the Collectors Rankings check also iotatradingcards.com\n\nNow have fun to play and earn them all. Feel free to join the official discord to find trading partners, talk about the project and much more. \n\n##\n## Legal informations\n\n- IOTA, Shimmer, Assembly, Firefly and Selv and the corresponding logos are trademarks of the IOTA Foundation (https://www.iota.org).\n##\n- All Logos, Project Names, aso. are only part of the game to make it an authentic IOTA Trading Cards set.
