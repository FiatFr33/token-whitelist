 "description": "The IOTAns just don't want to remain idle during this crazy time and we would like to use our skills to shed some light into these difficult days. From the sale of this collection, 100% goes to the support of refugee shelters for women and children, victims of the Ukraine invasion. A matter of heart for us. This is the idea behind our small \"IOTAns for humanity\" collection. A little advice... don't buy the NFTs because of the background... buy them because you like it! We just want to be as transparent as possible and post some updates on twitter! This collection is limited to a maximum of 75 IOTAns. Another OG collection will have a maximum of 75 IOTAns. There will never be more than 150 unique IOTAns in the future (excl. one promo edition limited to five designs)! Good luck \u0026 thx community. ",
