  "description": "Our collection consists of 10k unique Labralords. Each Labralord was randomly generated by combining 100 traits over 8 different categories. No matter how rare or common your Labralord is they all have the SAME utility. Labralords have an 7% royalty fee. 5% of these will go to buying and burning NFTs off the floor, and 2% will go back into the product. Before you mint, check out our website and Twitter to read up on what we are trying to build. We are building a platform that will empower you to make smarter trades of NFTs by giving you the proper insights close to real-time.",
