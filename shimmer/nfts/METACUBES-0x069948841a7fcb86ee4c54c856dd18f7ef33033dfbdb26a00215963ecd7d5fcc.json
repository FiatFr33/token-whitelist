 "description": "**METACUBES** is our second project that presents itself with geometric shapes and a sci-fi look. The METACUBE symbolically provides access to the Cubeverse, a galaxy consisting of countless different future **NFT's** based on simple geometric shapes. The total number of **840** possible METACUBES is made up as follow:\n\n\n  **800 METACUBES - Rarity \"normal\"**\n\n  \nThey consist of 50 different abstract looking frames, 8 different colours and backgrounds. This results in 400 different looking METACUBES, each of which exists twice, as a transition to another world always has two entrances. \n\n\n  **24 METACUBES - Metallic - Rarity \"rare\"**\n\n\n  In addition to the 800 METACUBES, there are 24 METACUBES Metallic (12 different cubes with two specimens each) that consist of a metal-like frame instead of an abstract frame and each have a different colour. \n\n\n  **16 METACUBES - Alien - Rarity \"ultra rare\"**\n\n  \nThe METACUBES of the type Alien (8 different cubes with two specimens each) are different from all other METACUBES, they are characterised by the fact that both the frame and the connected power cables for supplying the METACUBE are based on the same pattern. \n\n  \n**METACUBES Sales**\n  The sale will take place on **Tuesday 15.03 at 20:00 CET.**",
