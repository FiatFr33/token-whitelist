 "description": "Not so long to wait any more and we humans will discover worlds not with our own eyes seen before as we are approaching our first man mission to another planet ... Mars. I have to be honest with you. I studied physics and technology for space travel use cases in University for about two years before I dropped out. Yes, I am a University drop out. My psychological condition of paranoid schizophrenia made it unable for me to listen to the lectures as the background noises got louder and louder. So intense that I followed other projects then following traditional education. But in my time at University I wanted to create and engineer future interstellar bases for space and planetary missions. For this 100 piece unique NFT series I used some of my old pen\u0026 paper drawings of bases on another planet and modyfied them, so we can have an artist view in different angles in other places of a city on Mars once humanity makes it's biggest step in space travel so far. For some of them I used 3D models, others were developed from old pencil skeches. The paintings give you a realistic feeling of red light athmosphere on Mars. \n\nReal Drawings NFTs for as cheap as shimmer release prices!",
