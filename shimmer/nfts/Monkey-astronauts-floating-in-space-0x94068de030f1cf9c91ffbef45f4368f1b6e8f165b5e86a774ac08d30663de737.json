 "description": "These are colour pencil edits of monkey astronauts on a travel beyond the borders of our athmosphere. They float around in space and experience shift of time and space. I limited the monkeys to 30 NFTs to keep them a rare collecter's item. If you wonder why would an ape float helpless in space without their tribe? Honestly, I couldn't tell you. But I can tell you how I came up with the idea. I was sitting around, celebrating Shimmer release and brainstorming IOTA's future potential. It didn't take long that I was drifting away from the real topics such as utility and adoption and had my attention shift towards monetary gains and future price action. I then realized what I became. Just a monkey floating in space. When I was coming back to reality and the earth's ground I was missing space already. But no worries, IOTA spaceship will take us to there soon.",
