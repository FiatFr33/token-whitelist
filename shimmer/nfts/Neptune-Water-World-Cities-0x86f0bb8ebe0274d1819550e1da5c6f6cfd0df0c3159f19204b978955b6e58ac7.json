 "description": "When mankind is capable enough to expand their interplanetary missions from Mars to the edge of our solar system, surely Neptune will be the last stop before expanding into other solar systems. The gas giant is the farthest away from our sun and contains as much as 17 earth masses. It takes almost 165 years on earth for Neptune to fully circle the sun once. The high concentration of water in Neptunes lower athmosphere and mantle could make it a potential candidate for basic structures of life. However, Neptunes climate with wind speeds reaching from 30 m/s up to 600 m/s makes it almost impossible to even consider going there from todays technological standpoint. For this collection we ignore these facts and assume a change in athmosphere and climate will occur, making Neptune a huge water ball with potential for interplanetary space stations.",
