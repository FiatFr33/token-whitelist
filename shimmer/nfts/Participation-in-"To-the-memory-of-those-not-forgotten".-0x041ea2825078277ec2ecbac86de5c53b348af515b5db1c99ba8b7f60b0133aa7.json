 "description": "Hello friends of Reina IOTA.\nThis is not going to be a normal award space, we are still struggling with the ineractivity of the \"NFT's memorial\" in the collection \"To the memory of those not forgotten (catalog)\".\nTaking advantage of the fact that in the award space there is a small section where the user can write notes, we would like to use it to specify the personalization of the desired NFT within the collection...\nYou decide which one is the chosen one, and we can get in touch via Twitter in the accounts of @nakkimusic or @ReinaIota, if you wish it can also be through the Reina IOTA server in discord.\n\nThese prizes will only be awarded to users really interested in the project \"To the memory of those not forgotten\". Thank you!!!\nquestions and ideas are welcome!  \n\n",
