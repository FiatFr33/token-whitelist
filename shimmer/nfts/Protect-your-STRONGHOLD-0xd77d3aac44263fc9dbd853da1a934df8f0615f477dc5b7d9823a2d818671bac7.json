 "description": "As the title reads. I would suggest to mobilize your castle people and protect whats yours. Short time travel into middle age. Near eastern arabic countries trying to defend invasion from crusaders around 15th century. Archor ready? 3D Castle building with pencil sketches. Crusaders, watch out for the invisible assasins. When you see them it is too late and your castle got hijacked. Protect your friends, family and children. We hope you have enough apples, bread, cheese and freshly yield deer meat stocked in your granary, my Lord? Should we recruit some more spear bearers for basic defense? These are not photorealistic pictures. I used architectural 3D Designs for stronghold, churches, mosques and other buildings. Humans not photorealistic as well, have a closer look! Hope u enjoy, low license fee, only 1% Very nicely tradable. All NFTs with properties and attributes! \n",
