 "description": "Did you know that Renkert hates spring? He does!\n\nThis collection is diffrent. ItÂ´s not part of the regular series.\n\nEvery neerg collection Renkert costs only 1Mi. But the royalty level is at 70%. This means that the artist gets 70% of the price if somebedy (re)-sells his Renkert. Be aware about this when buying.\n\nThe neerg collection. This is art. This is satire.\n\nThis is one of the first \"Art Satire\" - Projects in the Cryptospace.\n\nThis \"Renkert Snofla\"-Collection again shows the development from the Basic Renkert Snofla without many effects to the final picture of this collection which has lots of artefacts and effects.\n\n7 Steps - 7 beautiful unique pictures.\n\nCheck out the details of the final version!\n\nThe way of creation is the artists secret.\n\nThis is the nreeg collection of our negative Renkert Snofla. Others will follow. Maybe. Or not?! Every collection could be the final one!\n\nOne Renkert/ person only.",
