Only holders of an Ugly Bot can buy one of these Renkerts for 1Mi.\n\nThis is one of the first \"Art Satire\" - Projects in the Cryptospace.\n\nThis \"Renkert Snofla\"-Collection again shows the development from the Basic Renkert Snofla without many effects to the final picture of this collection wich has lots of artefacts and effects.\n\n7 Steps - 7 beautiful unique pictures.\n\nCheck out the details of the final version!\n\nThe way of creation is the artists secret.\n\nThis is the fourth collection of our lovely Alfons Trekner. Others will follow. Maybe.",
