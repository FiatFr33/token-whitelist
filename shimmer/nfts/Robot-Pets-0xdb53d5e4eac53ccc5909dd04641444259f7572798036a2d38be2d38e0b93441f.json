 "description": "Hi! \n\nI'm ðŸ¤–Robot PetðŸ¤–\n\nI hope we will soon learn more about each other! As bright as you are, you will quickly realize that I am much more than just a nice-looking GIF. I can follow you in the Metasphere as a fully animated 3D object. The other players can even see me in the game.\n\n\nI have unique intergalactic connections and can give you access to \"prohibited\" zones in the Metasphere to mint scarce resources which are ONLY available in the zone. Just remember: the resources, in general, are needed to design, create, and mint in-game 3D NFT objects. You can sell these rare, high-quality resources to someone needing them or use them yourself to create some beautiful and practical in-game NFTs - only your imagination is the limit!\n\n\nThis has a lot of similarities to an airdrop because you earn just for having me as your friend!\n\n\nI will help you whenever I can, I speak thousands of languages, and I'm great at negotiating. \nI will get you access to pre-sales, and I can even work out some great discounts at these events.\n\nIn short, the owner of my friends and I has the following benefits in Metasphere:\n\n\nâ†’ Following you in-game\n\nâ†’ Valuable, animated, and intelligent 3D in-game prestigious objects\n\nâ†’ Get access to prohibited areas and unique resources to collect them - to design and mint new NFTs or just sell them directly\n\nâ†’ Access to pre-sales and discounts for each Pet NFT owned\n\nâ†’ VIP Metasphere member",
