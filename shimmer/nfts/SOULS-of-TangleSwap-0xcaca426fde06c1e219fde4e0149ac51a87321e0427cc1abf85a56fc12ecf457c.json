 "description": "The 𝓢𝓞𝓤𝓛𝓢 of TangleSwap are enigmatic, majestic creatures with a recently awakened interest in the IOTA \u0026 Shimmer universe. They bravely ventured into a long intergalactic journey through the tangleverse, and now they seek a place to call home. Their Shimmer home.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nKeep in mind: 𝓢𝓞𝓤𝓛𝓢 are not for the faint-hearted; the only way to earn the loyalty and companionship of a 𝓢𝓞𝓤𝓛 is by merit, not by purchase. Throughout all of 2023, there will be multiple activities, events, and opportunities aboard the Tangleship to spot a wild 𝓢𝓞𝓤𝓛 and make it your best Shimmer partner.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMake sure to follow their journey across Twitter \u0026 Discord, and find out how to earn your 𝓢𝓞𝓤𝓛! 🎭 🛸",
