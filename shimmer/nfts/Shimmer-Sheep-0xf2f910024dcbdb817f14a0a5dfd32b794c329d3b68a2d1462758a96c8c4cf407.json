 "description": "Shimmer Sheep is a collection of highly individual 3D Sheep, created by a novel randomization approach. During creation, IOTA projects were asked to submit their logos to be featured on the shirts and caps some of the Sheep are wearing, making this a true community effort.\n##\nSheep come with benefits. Many projects have chosen to sponsor „their“ Sheep, so watch out what your Sheep is wearing to claim the perks:\n- Stageholder shirt or cap -\u003e Stageholder Tokens\n- Shimmer Inu shirt or cap -\u003e 1 DAO Membership\n- IOTAShops shirt or cap -\u003e 20% Discount on IOTA Merch\n- MoonMoron Sheep -\u003e MoonMoron Tokens\n- Metaverse Sheep -\u003e Metaverse Trillionaires Badge, Giveaways, VIP Tickets\n##\nSome Sheep also „own“ NFTs, a small image by their left front foot.
