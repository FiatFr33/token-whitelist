 "description": "Take a stroll through the abandoned Kenmore Mental Asylum. Take in the beauty of nature reclaiming the grounds. Tall, dense grass, vibrant vines scaling the walls. But beware, for the property has a darker side. You may not be as alone here as you might first suspect. Footsteps, voices, apparitions in windows are aplenty at Kenmore, the site of countless deaths and tragedies, harkening back to an archaic era of medicine.\n\nThe Kenmore Collection is 47 pictures I took at Kenmore Mental Assylum, please enjoy.",
