 "description": "The owner of this award has proven to be a huge collector. He was among the first 10 collectors to collect a full *Regular Deck (cards 1-100 including card 42) and a full IOTA Community Hero Deck (Community Hero Card 1-10). This distinguishes him and entitles him to own one of the \"Trading Collectors Cards\" limited to 10 pieces.\n\n*The ownership of a Regular Collectors Card is represented the ownership of 100 Cards of the Regular Deck. If you have the Regular Collectors Card, I will not further check if the Regular Deck is (still) complete! ;) ",
