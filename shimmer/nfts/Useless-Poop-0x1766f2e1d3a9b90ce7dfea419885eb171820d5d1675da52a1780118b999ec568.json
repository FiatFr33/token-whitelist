 "description": "Just a useless NFT of poop floating against a substandard background resembling a sunset sky.\n##\nAn incredible 50% royalty makes it hard to sell it on for a profit if the owner doesn't want to make a loss. \n##\nI'm curious if this will ever sell or resell. Let the shit hit the fan!\n##\nThis is a meme NFT. It is not serious, it has no use, but obviously many such similar NFT seem to be trending. This NFT is not promoted by the creator on any social media platform. If someone else is doing it, then the shit has hit the fan.",
